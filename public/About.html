<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in the Washington, DC metro area.  After graduating high school, I ddi 2 years of community college at NVCC, and then moved to Mexico City where I studied to be an ESL Teacher.  In 1994, I moved back to the US and struggled to find a teaching job.  My girlfriend suggested I apply to a company that teaches people how to use computers.  I applied and got the job.</p>
